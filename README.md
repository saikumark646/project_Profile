# Project_Profile
Requirements:
1. Create a Django API endpoint that listens to POST and PATCH requests for creating and updating user profiles.
2. The endpoint should validate the incoming data, ensuring that required fields are provided and that the email is in a valid format.
3. If the data is valid, create a new profile or update the existing profile in the database.
4. Return appropriate HTTP responses and messages to indicate the success or failure of the operation.
5. Implement proper URL routing for the API endpoint.
6. Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms, ensuring that only authenticated users can create or update profiles.
7. Write unit tests to verify the functionality of the API endpoint.
